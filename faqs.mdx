## Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about Shield.

### General Questions

#### What is Shield?

Shield is a secure, blockchain-based verification system that allows you to create time-limited, attempt-restricted verification links. It combines traditional verification methods with Web3 technology for enhanced security and transparency.

#### How does Shield work?

Shield creates verification policies with customizable expiration times and attempt limits. When someone accesses a Shield link, their verification is recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of the verification attempt.

#### Is Shield free to use?

Yes, Shield is currently free to use. We're committed to providing secure verification tools to everyone.

### Technical Questions

#### What blockchain does Shield use?

Shield is built on the Base network, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that provides fast transactions and low fees while maintaining security.

#### Do I need cryptocurrency to use Shield?

No, you don't need any cryptocurrency to create or use Shield verification links. The blockchain operations are handled automatically in the background.

#### How is my data stored?

Verification policies are stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage, and verification records are stored on the blockchain for transparency and immutability.

### Security Questions

#### How secure is Shield?

Shield uses industry-standard encryption and blockchain technology to ensure your verification data is secure and tamper-proof. All verification attempts are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail.

#### Can verification links be reused?

No, verification links have configurable attempt limits (default is 3 attempts) and expiration times (default is 1 hour). Once these limits are reached, the link becomes invalid.

#### What happens after a link expires?

Once a verification link expires or reaches its attempt limit, it can no longer be used for verification. The verification record remains on the blockchain for audit purposes.

### Usage Questions

#### How do I create a verification link?

1. Go to [Shield App](https://shield-app.vercel.app)
2. Enter your verification policy details
3. Set expiration time and max attempts
4. Click "Generate Link"
5. Share the generated link with your receiver

#### Can I customize expiration times and attempt limits?

Yes! You can customize both the expiration time (in seconds) and maximum number of attempts when creating your verification policy. The defaults are 3600 seconds (1 hour) and 3 attempts.

#### How do I check verification status?

All verification attempts are recorded on the blockchain. You can view the verification status through the Shield app or by checking the transaction on the Base network block explorer.
